Array Size	Heap Time	Tree Time
1000			1			374
5000			2			1644
10000			7			1940
50000			21			3156
100000			24			3506
150000			34			5005
200000			74			5937

The worst case scenario of each is:
	HeapSort is O(n log n)
	TreeSort is O(n^2)

HeapSort works putting the largest number on the root of the tree using heapify.
While TreeSort uses inorder traversal.
	
Most of the places I searched ignored duplicate values for TreeSort causing the array to be smaller. In my code I accepted values that were equal.
